# HANGMAN

## Functionality
This is a basic implementation of the game "Hangman" for The Odin Project curriculum using Ruby. This supports saving a game that can later be loaded. This implemenation only supports a single save file. The word bank contains only English words. The secret word will have between 5 and 12 letters. 


## Meta
This was my first project utilizing serialization, JSON in this case, and IO streams. I enjoyed this project as it supports a save feature, which saves data in a JSON file, which can then be parsed back into a ruby object. This specific implementation only supports one save file, as supporting multiple save files should be trivial, and the true purpose of this Repository is to show basic IO/serializtion skills.
